#Robot Project

This repository contains a Java project for simulating a robot's movement on a 2D grid. The project includes the implementation of the Robot class, as well as several test classes to verify its functionality.

##Testing

The project includes an extensive set of JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of the Robot class. The test classes cover different aspects of the Robot's functionality, including input validation, command execution, movement, and direction changes. The tests are designed to verify both valid and invalid scenarios, providing comprehensive coverage of the codebase.
